# RV32I-5Stage-Pipelined-RISC-V-Processor
5-stage pipelined RV32I RISC-V processor implemented in synthesizable Verilog with modular pipeline registers and control signal propagation. Verified using a SystemVerilog testbench and waveform analysis. Demonstrates instruction overlap, stage isolation, and correct writeback timing
